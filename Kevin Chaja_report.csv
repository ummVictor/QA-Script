660cfb878d3577341c19fa85,2,2024-02-25,Login/UI/Game/Build Deck,"User case: As a user, when I went to go build a deck, I found the UI kind of confusing at first. I didn't really know how much cards has to be in a deck and first time I built a deck, I didn't know I had to have it saved and selected before finding a match.  Took a little bit of playing with, but I understand how it works now.","I kind of expected at first when I build a deck, it would show the number of cards I have in the deck as well as expecting a drag and drop system for building decks. I also expected that the deck would automatically save when I exit, or at least a pop up reminder to save.","In order to build a deck, users have to selected a card and a menu pops up prompting the user to add or remove card. If the user adds, they must exit the card menu and the card will then be displayed in the deck. There are no indicators on how much cards there needs to be in the deck. The only indicator will appear when you save a deck and the menu tells you that you don't have enough cards and tells you how many more cards are needed. When saving a deck, you must name it and it is only after you exit the build deck menu where you gotta select the deck you want to use when you play a game",Yes,No,Kevin Chaja
660cfb878d3577341c19fa86,3,2024-02-25,Login/UI/Game/Tutorial,"Bug?: After completing the tutorial, I went back to play it again. However, it seems that the tutorial acts as a training ground however, you only have limited amount of cards, leading to a point during the game where both the players and the AI have no cards meaning both cannot draw new ones. If the AI runs out of cards and doesn't have any cards to draw, the AI opponent is stuck in the drawing phase and rather than switching turns,the AI just stays and waits the entire turn. The player must wait until the opponents turn is over, and is either stuck doing nothing or attacks the enemy only to switch turns and wait until the enemy's timer to finish to switch to their turn.",I was expecting to get more cards in the tutorial instead of a limited amount rather than having to wait for the opponents clock to finish because they also can't draw any cards,I had to wait the entire opponents turn to make a move cause they didn't want to skip,Yes,No,Kevin Chaja
